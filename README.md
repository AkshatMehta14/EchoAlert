# ECHO ALERT - CAC 2024
## Introduction
EchoAlert revolutionizes the school shooting response process, securely sending out an alert to all students and uses machine learning to highlight danger zones to aid first responders. When opening the app create an account through the sign up page, or log in. From there you are brought to the home screen where there is an alarm button, in the same way a student would pull a fire alarm to report a fire, a student can press this button in case of a shooting. The app then verifies the report and then sends out a notification to everyone with the app under the school, similar to an amber alert. Everyone is then brought to the active school shooting page, where the app displays a live map of the school with danger zones created by our AI unsupervised learning model. It uses microphones, gyroscopes, location tracking, and reports to generate danger zones throughout the school. It has life saving features, a it reduces student casualties by preventing them from entering danger zones, b it allows law enforcement to neutralize the threat by triangulating the shooters position faster, minutes save lives.
